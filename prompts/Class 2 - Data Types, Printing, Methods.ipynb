    "\n",
    "variable_name = variable_value\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names can be anything you want, but have to follow the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    " - they can't begin with numbers or special characters\n",
    " - a multi-word variable name must be connected with hyphens or underscores (underscores are preferred)\n",
    " - you shouldn't use a variable name that already represents pre-existing data within Python\n",
    "  - ie, since print() is a function, don't make a variable called 'print'\n",

    "### Data Types: A Brief Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (and most programming languages) have about a dozen or so different data types that are used for specific types of tasks within the language itself.  Here's a short introduction to the major ones you'll be using frequently:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **integers:**  whole numbers\n",
    " - **floats:** numbers with decimals after them\n",
    " - **strings:**  text.  Strings have to be enclosed within quotes in order to be interpreted as text.\n",
    " - **lists:**  containers that store multiple values according to a specific order.  Are denoted by brackets.  ie, [1, 2, 6, True, False].  Most data is stored in lists.\n",
    " - **dictionaries:**  store items as key/value pairs.  Have no concept of order.  Are denoted by braces.  ie, {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}  Most information is *passed around* as a dictionary.  Commonly used in API's.\n",
    " - **functions:**  pre-defined sets of instructions that you can re-use on the fly.  Are denoted by the word *def*.  ie, def my_function(arg1, arg2): return some_value\n",
